            <h2>How NeedMatch Works</h2>
            <div class="steps">
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>1. NGO Registration</h3>
                    <p>NGOs create profiles by entering their name, location, mission, multimedia, and needs.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>2. Find & Filter</h3>
                    <p>Donors search NGOs using filters like type (old age home/orphanage), what to donate, and location—no login needed.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>3. Connect & Donate</h3>
                    <p>Donors fill a form; NGOs receive it, confirm the donation, and send a receipt with a unique donation ID.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>4. Secure Follow-up</h3>
                    <p>After donation, donors get thank you messages, photos, and future updates on urgent needs.</p>
                </div>
